# GAME CENTER

Game center is a simple project in Java using JavaFX. You can choose between two games - pong and memory game.

## Pong

In the game, a ball moves across the screen and the player controls a paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from reaching the edge of the screen. If the ball reaches the edge of the screen, the game ends.

## Memory Game

The game is a classic card matching game where the player needs to match pairs of cards by turning them over two at a time. It supports different card configurations (8, 16, and 24 cards) which can be changed during the game.
